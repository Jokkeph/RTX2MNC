The files in this folder have as of now 3 purposes. 13 Nov. 2017 (updated 19th Jan. 2018)

I will describe the individual python program further down, but for now i will describe it more generally.
The first purpose is to take 4 directories of different files.
0. 			-- Inputs should be of type dir/dir/     contains files.dcm
1. -defon  		-- is often of type MR
2. -yaxis		-- is often of type ADC
3. -xaxis		-- is often of type PET
4. -rt			-- if often of type RT struct
5. -re			-- Describes the directory of files we want to resample as
6. -out			-- Name of output directory or path everything will be placed in
7. ---totalscatter	-- (Optional)a flag with no input, creates one big scatterplot(y=adc, x=pet(suv)) with all the files
8. ---xdim		-- (Optional)Length of x axis on scatterplots default = 35
9. ---title		-- (Optional)Title placed in the top of the scatterplot default = Scatterplots

Example of use:
python main.py  -defon FDG/MR/ -yaxis FDG_ADC/dir_with_dcmfiles/ -xaxis FDG_PET/dir_with_dcmfiles/ -rt FDG_RT/dir_with_1rtfile/ -re FDG_MR/dir_with_dcmfiles/ ---xdim 35 ---title FDG_b200-1000_20-30min -o FDG_ADC_FUGUE_b200 ---totalscatter


Given these files the program work in the following order:
1. Create directory named MNCfiles where the program will run 
2. Convert all DICOM files to .mnc format in respected folders: defmnc, yaxis, xaxis, rt, resampledas, they are named using date_time format of the MR scan.
3. Using date_time we rename all the defmnc files as the studyuidrt
4. copy all rt files into MNCfiles in folder rt
5. Run rtx2mnc on the rt files and defmnc files using studyuidrt name on defmnc files we only convert files that actually match. Output is in RTOut
6. Rename all RTOut files as patientID
7. Resample all files as target of -re flag output is in Resampled_xaxis, Resampled_yaxis and so on. 
8. Now we convert the Resampled files into nifti format. Output is in nifti_xaxis, nifti_yaxis and so on
9. Calculates the SUV value for every xaxis file and put into a list. 
10. Calls the R script with the nifti files as input. Apply the niftirtmask, divide the cells by the SUV value, and plot as scatterplot yaxis adc, xaxis pet output as pdf in ScatterPlots_PDF


The second purpose is divided in two options single target and directory target.

Single:			-- Inputs should be of type dir/     contains files.dcm, or .mnc files
1. --mr 		-- (Optional)is often of type MR
2. --rts		-- is often of type RT struct
3. --pet		-- is often of type PET, could be CT

IMPORTANT: When only --pet --rts is given then --pet is the file RT is being sampled to. so if only --pet is given then rt is defined on --pet
	   When both --mr --pet --rts is given --mr is the file RT is being sampled to. So if --mr is given then rt is defined on --mr

Directory:		--auto has to be before any other argument!
0. --auto		-- Inputs should be of type dir/dir/     contains files.dcm
1. --mr 		-- is often of type MR
2. --rts		-- is often of type RT struct
3. --pet		-- (Optional)is often of type PET, could be CT

For both options the following happends:
1. Converts dicom files to minc format
2. Uses rtx2mnc on files and converts RT into mnc files
3. Resamples files as mr input, output is placed in MNCfiles/Resampled  

The third purpose is to combine png files.
The call will combine min 2 and max 4 png files on the same page e.g 

	png2 png3
	png1 png4

Example of use:
python main.py -p2 dir_with_pngfiles/ -p3 dir_with_pngfiles/ -p1 dir_with_pngfiles/ -p4 dir_with_pngfiles/ -pout outputdirectory

Python files:
-------------------------------main.py-------------------------------

Create the parser and arguments first, then given certain arguments call the other python files doing what we want with the specific arguments. 
Before calling other files we check if the arguments exists. 

-------------------------------functions.py-------------------------------

Contains various functions used in the different processes, the functions are placed in sections, to easily see which functions is used in which files. 

-------------------------------Pipe_rtx2mnc.py-------------------------------

First we check if RT is dicom, and then we get the Studyuid, and seriesinstanceuid, to compare if files match later on. 

Then there is case handling for all the different cases of input e.g 
mr.mnc dir/pet.dcm rt, 
or 
dir/mr.dcm/ dir/pet.dcm rt,
The handling is done using .endswith(.mnc) so not so robust but sufficient for now

When entering a case, we verify if the files match(definedon vs rt), and have a case for the flag -revres so if we would normally resample the pet as the rt, we would now resample the rt as the pet

Its also here we use fetchstudyuid_dirscp and verifymincfile_dirscp from the functions file, here we also force use the RT file given the flag --forcert.

-------------------------------Plot_ADC_SUV.py-------------------------------

Basically calls functions and scripts doing what is described in the 10 points in the 'first purpose' stated in the beginning of this file

-------------------------------UsePipe_rtx2mncOnDirectories.py-------------------------------

Main purpose is to create 3 different cases, first we handle input for --auto argument and 3 inputs, then if only 2 arguments and --auto given, then if no --auto given.

Every one of these cases results in calling Pipe_rtx2mnc with the corresponding arguments. 
But before this happends we call handleinput_dirscp that has additional error handling.
We also check using output from handleinput_dirscp that we only call the pipe_rtx2mnc script given that the files match(pet/mr -- rt)

-------------------------------import.R-------------------------------

The import.R file takes 4 arguments, --adc(-a), --pet(-p), --rt(-r), --constant(-d)
First we check if the input exists, then we import the data into variables, pet, adc, rt
Now we multiply the rt mask onto the pet, and load this into the petmask variable
Then we multiply the rt mask onto the adc, and divide every number with the constant given, and loads into variable adcmask
Now convert the two into matrix format, and set all (0,0) coordinates as NA so we don't plot e.g 3 million (0,0) points.
Now plot as scatterplot.
